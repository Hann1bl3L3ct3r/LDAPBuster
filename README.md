# LDAPBuster
Script to automate the ARP poisoning and credential harvesting of network devices that utilize LDAP for authentication.

This script started as a way to automated the communication between firewalls and remote access appliances that use AD and LDAP for authentication but expended to allow the targetting of any two addresses and parse credentials passed between them.
